					<h1>Climate</h1>
					<h2>Noun</h2>
					<h3>Origin: Late Middle English, possibly originally from greek "klinein", meaning slope</h3>
					<blockquote>The weather conditions prevailing in an area in general or over a long period...a region with particular prevailing weather conditions</blockquote>
					<aside class="notes">When talking about climate, we are immediately talking about the region as well as it's atmospheric conditions. The more I looked into this, the more I could see that the Bay and it's climate are linked in a complex way</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="./images/graves.png" class="full">
					<h1 style="color:white">The climate of the bay throughout history</h1>
					<p style="color:white">It's likely that the bay area has been ice-free, vegetated, and capable of supporting grazing animals since at least 14,500 years BP. Evidence of human occupation goes back to the Mesolithic- 12,000 years BP. The bay itself has been infilling with sediment since at least the 18th century, partially due to manmade changes such as the construction of the railway viaduct and the reclamation of the saltmarshes.</p>

					<small class="attribution" style="color:white">Geographr: Karl and Ali CC BY-SA 2.0</small>
					<aside class="notes">So again, when talking about the climate of the bay, it has been changing over millennia</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="./images/stream.png" class="full">
					<h1 style="color:white">Equilibrium</h1>
					<p style="color:white">The bay is an extremely dynamic environment, but periodically reaches a state of equilibrium where the inflow and outflow of sediment are relatively equal, the river channels don't move too much, and there isn't a lot of erosion or flooding. Major disturbances have happened in the 19th century, and the 1950s and 60s, but the current state is relatively stable.</p>
					<p style="color:white" class="fragment">... or it would be, if it weren't for climate change!</p>

					<small class="attribution" style="color:white">Wikimedia Commons: Ian Taylor CC BY-SA 2.0</small>
					<aside class="notes">So climate change has the potential to disturb the very fragile equilibrium, as other drastic changes have done in the past. We need to look at what changes might occur, what the symptoms would be, and what is being done to mitigate</aside>

				<h1>Impact on limestones</h1>
				<ul>
				<li>Increases in biomass due to longer growing season</li>
				<li>Invading species outcompeting existing species, and changes in composition of communities</li>
				<li>Increased erosion of thin soils in grykes due to more intense rainfall</li>
				<li>Change in chemistry of rainfall leading to more erosion of limestone</li>
				<li>Less frost damage due to warmer winters</li>
				<li>Increased risk of wildfires</li>
				<li>Decreased flowering and increased vulnerability to pathogens in heather species</li>
				</ul>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/cliffs.png" class="full">
				<h1>Impact on coastal habitats</h1>
				<ul>
				<li>Increased tidal flooding and higher storm surge heights</li>
				<li>Acceleration of erosion</li>
				<li>Increased sedimentation and barrier breaches causing loss of saline lagoons</li>
				<li>Oxidation of sediments and organic matter triggering release of Carbon Dioxide and Methane</li>
				<li>Changes in river flows changing the energy and hence sedimentation accreting in the bay</li>
				<li>Managed realignment and hard coastal defences resulting in coastal squeeze or total habitat loss</li>

					<h2>Helping to mitigate</h2>
					<p>Peat bogs and woodland contribute to carbon sequestration and storage but if degraded will emit significant amounts back into the atmosphere</p>
					<p>Salt marshes regulate many coastal processes such as flooding and erosion</p>
					<p>Tree planting along rivers shades water, reducing temperature rises </p>
					<p>"Re-alignment" or moving defenses back to higher land because of flood risk may increase opportunities for additional intertidal habitats</p>

				<h1>Sea Level Changes</h1>
				<p>Sea Level changes come from multiple sources- melting of ice sheets, isostatic adjustment, and storm surges</p>
				<p>Also decreasing salinity and increased wave height</p>
				<p>Projected sea level rise for Edinburgh is 7-54cm by 2095, relative to 1995 levels</p>
				<p>Projection for Morecmabe Bay is that sea level rise won't be a major issue until 50-100 years time</p>
				<p>But ...current defenses, for example the training walls that keep the route to Sunderland Village open, are becoming increasingly ineffective</p>

				<h1>Weather changes</h1>
				<p>Anecdotally we are seeing more windy conditions. In previous years, of 4 suitable days for diving at Roa Island we would perhaps manage 3 dives. Now it's more likely that 3 will be "blown out" and 1 will be divable.</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="./images/seadefences.png" class="full">
				<h1>Manmade impacts</h1>
				<p>The Bay probably reached a stage of dynamic equilibrium in the 1830s and again (after sea defences were added) in the 1950s</p>
				<p>As the training walls deteriorate the estuary will return to a more natural meandering regime, with implications for saltmarsh erosion and flood defence stability</p>
				<p>Geological features around (eg) Walney Island are vulnerable to changes of sediment movement caused by sea defenses</p>
				<p>"Holding the line" to defend coastal towns and villages may mean losing low-lying coastal habitats such as sand dunes, saltmarshes, mudlfats</p>
				<p>However preferred plan predicts net gain of intertidal saltmarsh, sandflats and mudflats around the bay</p>
